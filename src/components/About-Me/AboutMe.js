                    <p> Hello, my name is Ayberk. I am from Turkey. Currently I am studying Computer Engineering second year.
                    Moreover, I do study on web development for more than a year as well. However, my coding adventure started nearly 8 years ago.
                    Recently I put my hands on React and I actually hated it. However, it's satisfying to build website with it.
                    I cannot say I am the best out there, but I know that I will accomplish what's given to me. Earning money with as a freelancer
                    front-end developer is of course one of my goals. However, I honestly want to earn sweet sweet experience with this kinda jobs. Therefore,
                    I will be more than happy to work with you.
